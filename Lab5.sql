-- 1. Show the cities of agents booking an order for a customer whose id is 'c006'. Use joins this time; no subqueries. 

	SELECT agents.city
          FROM agents INNER JOIN orders
            ON orders.aid = agents.aid
         WHERE orders.cid = 'c006';

-- 2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least one order for a customer in Kyoto, sorted by pid from highest to lowest. 
-- Use joins; no subqueries. 

SELECT DISTINCT orders.pid
	   FROM orders INNER JOIN agents ON orders.aid = agents.aid
		       INNER JOIN customers ON orders.cid = customers.cid
          WHERE customers.city = 'Kyoto'
          ORDER BY pid DESC;

-- 3. Show the names of customers who have never placed an order. Use a subquery.

         SELECT name
           FROM customers
          WHERE cid NOT IN (SELECT cid
                            FROM orders);

-- 4. Show the names of customers who have never placed an order. Use an outer join. 

	SELECT customers.name
	  FROM orders RIGHT OUTER JOIN customers ON orders.cid = customers.cid
	  WHERE ordnum IS null;


-- 5. Show the names of customers who placed at least one order through an agent in their own city, along with those agent(s') names. 

	SELECT DISTINCT customers.name, agents.name
		FROM orders INNER JOIN agents ON orders.aid = agents.aid
			INNER JOIN customers ON orders.cid = customers.cid
          WHERE customers.city = agents.city;
          

-- 6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, 
-- along with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the customer has ever placed an order with that agent. 


	SELECT customers.name, agents.name, customers.city
	  FROM customers INNER JOIN agents ON customers.city = agents.city;
	  

-- 7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the fewest different kinds of products. 
-- (Hint: Use count and group by on the Products table.)

	SELECT name, city
	  FROM customers
	 WHERE city in (SELECT city 
                        FROM products
                        GROUP BY city
                        ORDER BY COUNT(products.city)
                        LIMIT 1);
